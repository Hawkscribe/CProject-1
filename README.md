<p>This project currently uses an HTTP server for real-time communication. The core functionality is in place and working well.<br>

In the next version, I plan to upgrade the communication layer to use WebSockets to enable true real-time, bidirectional data exchange between the client and server. This will improve performance and user experience by allowing instant updates without needing to refresh the page.<br>

Work on integrating Cloudinary for image uploads is still ongoing. If you notice any major issues related to Cloudinary, please feel free to report them.<br>

The project will be live soonâ€”stay tuned for updates!</p>
